👨🏻‍💻 I'm a first year Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the Utrecht University.

🔬 I'm learning to solve real-world complex problems by programming machines and developing human-centered algorithms that use Machine learning and Deep learning approaches

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's studies and defining my Master's thesis starting in the Winter 2024.


# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Challenges
I have experience contributing to [Predictive troubleshooting for medical devices](https://eit-innovaid.eu/hackathon-challenge-d-predicting-troubleshooting-for-medical-devices/), an hackathon project at the Utrecht Medical Center, for preventing infusion pumps from breaking using NLP with Neural approaches.

I am currently working on a project for Improving Water level prediction using Exogenous variables and Neural Networks as part of an [AI4LS2](https://taikai.network/en/gradient0/hackathons/AI4LS2), a large hackathon project, proposed by the University of Vienna. 

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have implemented the paper Word2vec and reproduced the original results by running an tracking experiments.
Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry]().

I have implemented the tutorials from the masterclass [Numerical and Analytical methods for spatially-extended neurobiological networks](https://github.com/danieleavitabile/numerical-analysis-mathematical-neuroscience?tab=readme-ov-file) taught by the PhD D.Avitabile at the Utrecht University. 

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
I have professional experience working as **Software Engineer** for a Japanese international company and United Arab Emirates' startup after graduating from my Bachelor.
I mainly worked to solve AI challenges and developed components for IT, Fintech and Booking companies.
