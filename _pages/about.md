👨🏻‍💻 I'm a first year Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the Utrecht University.

🔬 I'm learning to solve real-world complex problems by programming machines and developing human-centered algorithms that leverage Machine learning and Deep learning.

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's studies and defining my Master's thesis starting in the Winter 2024.


# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Challenges
I have experience contributing to [Predictive troubleshooting for medical devices](https://eit-innovaid.eu/hackathon-challenge-d-predicting-troubleshooting-for-medical-devices/), an hackathon project at the Utrecht Medical Center, for preventing infusion pumps from breaking using NLP with Neural approaches.

I am currently working on a project for Improving Water level prediction using Exogenous variables and Neural Networks as part of an [AI4LS2](https://taikai.network/en/gradient0/hackathons/AI4LS2), a large hackathon project, proposed by the University of Vienna. 

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have implemented a small scale variant of the paper Glove, as part of a university coursework, and validated the learned embeddings through their similarity. Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://github.com/RiccardoCampanella/MLHVL_Language/tree/main).

I have implemented the tutorials from the masterclass [Numerical and Analytical methods for spatially-extended neurobiological networks]() taught by the PhD D.Avitabile at the Utrecht University. 

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
I have professional experience working as **Software Engineer** for a Japanese international company and United Arab Emirates' startup after graduating from my Bachelor.
I mainly worked to solve AI challenges and developed components for IT, Fintech and Booking companies.  

## 🤝 Groups and Activities
I have joined the AI Safety Group in the Netherlands and, after completing the course [AI Safety Foundamentals](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/) (2023 and 2024), I'm interested in working on the Alignment problems, whether it is about goal misgeneralization, reward mispecification, interpretability or privacy issues. In the final project for the 2023 cohort of AISF I have successfully showed how a DQN agent learns to play a game and misgeneralizes by carrying a misalligned behaviour using proxy features to achieve its goal.
